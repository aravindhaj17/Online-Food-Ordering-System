🍔 Online Food Ordering System (Graph + Priority Queue)
📌 Overview
This is a Java-based simulation project of an Online Food Ordering System that demonstrates how:

Graphs can represent restaurants, users, and delivery routes.

Dijkstra’s Algorithm can calculate the shortest delivery path.

Priority Queue can manage orders by priority (e.g., urgent orders, high-value orders).

This project is a mini-project for Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) concepts applied to a real-world scenario.

⚡ Features
Add multiple restaurants with menus.

Add users with location IDs.

Place orders with a priority score.

Orders are processed in priority order using a PriorityQueue.

Shortest delivery time is calculated using Dijkstra’s algorithm on a weighted graph.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Java

Data Structures Used:

Graph (Adjacency List)

Priority Queue (Heap)

Dijkstra’s Algorithm

How It Works
Restaurants and users are added as nodes in a graph.

Edges represent distances (delivery times) between nodes.

A priority queue manages orders by urgency.

The system delivers orders in order of priority while calculating the shortest path to the user
